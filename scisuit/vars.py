"""
this file/module intended to serve as a temporary storage for variables \n
those are exported from other parts \n

## How it works: 
1) A list variable is created and named as myvar \n
2) To access the variable from other parts, issue the following command \n \n

>> from scisuit.vars import myvar \n \n

now myvar can be used as a variable. \n

P.S: Needless to say, myvar will not be visible as a text
